`smolagents` is a library that enables you to run powerful agents in a few lines of code. It offers:

✨ **Simplicity**: the logic for agents fits in ~1,000 lines of code (see [agents.py](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/agents.py)). We kept abstractions to their minimal shape above raw code!

🧑‍💻 **First-class support for Code Agents**. Our [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) writes its actions in code (as opposed to "agents being used to write code"). To make it secure, we support executing in sandboxed environments via [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) or via Docker.

🤗 **Hub integrations**: you can [share/pull tools or agents to/from the Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_hub) for instant sharing of the most efficient agents!

🌐 **Model-agnostic**: smolagents supports any LLM. It can be a local `transformers` or `ollama` model, one of [many providers on the Hub](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-providers), or any model from OpenAI, Anthropic and many others via our [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) integration.

👁️ **Modality-agnostic**: Agents support text, vision, video, even audio inputs! Cf [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/examples/web_browser) for vision.

🛠️ **Tool-agnostic**: you can use tools from any [MCP server](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.ToolCollection.from_mcp), from [LangChain](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_langchain), you can even use a [Hub Space](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_space) as a tool.
